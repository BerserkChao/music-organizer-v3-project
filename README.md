I just wanted to add this as an update to let you know that I forgot to upload the music-organizer-v3 project
(with all the code I added) to show you my progress in the Lab. I will submit it this evening.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

**UPDATE for Step 30.
I realized that by adding the break at the end of the loop will prevent it to execute the body
multiple times and the result that would get printed out in the console will be 10 and will not 
loop until 95.
